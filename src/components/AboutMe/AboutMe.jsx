                Hi! I'm a passionate Full Stack Software Developer with a knack for building dynamic, high-performance web applications. With a strong foundation in MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), I have developed a wide array of applications, ranging from responsive front-end interfaces to scalable back-end systems.

I thrive in solving complex problems through clean, efficient code and love staying up-to-date with the latest technologies. Whether it's working on web development, API integration, or database management, I focus on delivering robust, secure, and user-friendly solutions.

Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I am committed to creating software that not only meets user needs but also exceeds expectations. In addition to coding, I enjoy collaborating with teams to bring ideas to life and am always open to new opportunities and challenges that can help me grow as a developer.                </p>
